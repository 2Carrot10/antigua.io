Jain Foundation Inc.,17,"To orchestrate and expedite a cure for LGMD2B (Limb Girdle Muscular dystrophy 2B). Goal: There is no cure or therapy currently for this rare disease. Most of the patients with this disease have no hope since it is a genetic disease and frequently very difficult to diagnose. The drug companies are not interested in finding a cure because the patient population is very small, so they won’t profit from it. The simple goal of the foundation is to give real hope to these patients by doing everything it takes to get to a cure. 
 Vision: The Jain Foundation’s vision is to fund and manage research worldwide and to hasten the focused development of understanding of this disease at the molecular level. It is also to simultaneously collaborate with biotech, pharmaceutical companies and academic institutions to take this understanding of the disease from the bench (research) to the bedside (to the patients). Additionally, the foundation is helping the diagnosis of the disease by making physicians and patients aware of the clinical symptoms of the disease. 
 The foundation has 4 full-time staff including the president and 3 scientific directors. All of them work out of the Redmond office. They all hold Ph.ds in Biology and a minimum of 10 years experience in scientific research. There are also 3 additional part time staff members. One of them manages patient communication from the Redmond office. One works from Washington DC and holds a Ph.D in Physics and the third part-time consultant is a Ph.D student at Harvard University.

I went to the Film and Fika for ""It's Raining Women"" which illustrated the struggles of women all over the world on the issue of equal pay.
